### 🔄 Project Awareness & Context

- **This CLAUDE.md file serves as the central planning document** containing the project's architecture, goals, style, and constraints.
- **Use GitHub Issues/Projects for task management** - Check existing issues before starting a new task. Create new issues for tasks that aren't tracked.
- **Use consistent naming conventions, file structure, and architecture patterns** as described in this document.
- **Use venv_linux** (the virtual environment) whenever executing Python commands, including for unit tests.
- ****CRITICAL:** **Poetry is used for dependency management** - use `poetry install` and `poetry add` for package management.
- ****CRITICAL:** **Do NOT use mock model/lib/data expect testing**

## Core Principles

**IMPORTANT: You MUST follow these principles in all code changes:**

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- Simplicity should be a key goal in design
- Choose straightforward solutions over complex ones whenever possible
- Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, and debug

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Avoid building functionality on speculation
- Implement features only when they are needed, not when you anticipate they might be useful in the future

### Open/Closed Principle

- Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Design systems so that new functionality can be added with minimal changes to existing code


### Essential poetry Commands

### 🧱 Code Structure & Modularity

- **Never create a file longer than 350 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).
- **Use peotry** for environment variables.

### 🧪 Testing & Reliability

- **Always create Pytest unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Tests should live in a `/tests` folder** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case
- **For VA models**, include tests for:
  - Data preprocessing pipeline
  - Model training/prediction
  - Metric calculations (CSMF accuracy, COD accuracy)
  - Stratification logic

### 🚀 Runtime Validation

- **CRITICAL: No feature is complete until it runs successfully**
  - Code integration alone is NOT sufficient
  - Must execute the feature end-to-end without crashes
  - If dependencies fail (segfault, import errors), implement fallback handling before claiming completion
  
- **Validation Requirements:**
  - ✅ Code runs without crashes
  - ✅ Produces expected outputs  
  - ✅ Integrates with existing pipeline
  - ✅ Handles failures gracefully
  
- **If external dependencies fail:**
  - Add try/except protection
  - Implement fallback behavior
  - Warn user clearly
  - DO NOT claim feature is "ready to use"

### ✅ Task Completion

- **Update GitHub Issues with progress** - Add brief comments about approach and any blockers encountered during development.
- **Link PRs to Issues** - Use keywords like `Fixes #123` in PR descriptions to auto-close issues when merged.
- **Create new GitHub Issues** for any sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development, linking them to the parent issue when applicable.
- **Follow team's issue closing policy** - Issues typically close on PR merge, not immediately after code completion.
- **Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for issue and PR management** - Leverage `gh` commands for creating issues, PRs, and managing workflow efficiently.
- **For pipeline deliverables**, ensure output files are saved in appropriate directories:
  - `results/baseline/benchmark_results.csv`
  - `results/transfer/transfer_results.csv`
  - `results/active/active_learning_results.csv`
- **After finish implementation, always run it once as confirmation. Feature is NOT complete if it crashes or fails at runtime. If it is timeout, you can assume it pass and tell the user run it itself**

### 🔄 Development Workflow

- **Branch Naming Conventions**:

  - Feature branches: `feature/issue-123-brief-description`
  - Bug fixes: `fix/issue-123-brief-description`
  - Hotfixes: `hotfix/critical-issue-description`
  - Always include issue number when applicable
- **Commit Message Standards**:

  - Follow conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
  - Example: `feat(auth): add JWT token validation`
  - Keep first line under 72 characters
  - Add detailed description after blank line if needed

### 📎 Style & Conventions

- **Use Python** as the primary language.
- **Follow PEP8**, use type hints, and format with `black`.
- **Use `pydantic` for data validation**.
- **Use `pandas` for data manipulation** and `scikit-learn` for ML utilities.
- **For VA-specific algorithms (openVA, InSilicoVA, InterVA)**:
  - Use the Docker image provided at `models/insilico/Dockerfile`
  - Keep R code isolated within Docker containers
  - Use Python to orchestrate Docker container calls
  - Document any new R dependencies in the Dockerfile
- Write **docstrings for every function** using the Google style:
  ```python
  def example():
      """
      Brief summary.

      Args:
          param1 (type): Description.

      Returns:
          type: Description.
      """
  ```

### 📚 Documentation & Explainability

- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added, dependencies change, or setup steps are modified.
- **Comment non-obvious code** and ensure everything is understandable to a mid-level developer.
- When writing complex logic, **add an inline `# Reason:` comment** explaining the why, not just the what.

### 🧠 AI Behavior Rules

- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** – only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **For VA-specific terms**, use standard terminology (COD, CSMF, VA, etc.) consistently.
- **Use context7 MCP for library documentation** - When you need current documentation for libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, openVA, etc.), use the context7 MCP tools instead of relying on potentially outdated knowledge.

### ⏱️ Execution Time Constraints

- **Claude Code has a 5-minute execution timeout** for any single command.
- **For long-running computations** (e.g., extensive model training, large-scale cross-validation):

  - Create standalone Python scripts that users can run manually
  - Make scripts executable with proper shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python`)
  - Include clear usage instructions at the top of the script:
    ```python
    """
    Long-running VA model training script

    Usage: python train_models.py --data path/to/data.csv

    Expected runtime: ~2 hours for full cross-validation
    Progress will be saved to checkpoints/ directory
    """
    ```
  - Implement checkpointing to allow resuming interrupted runs
  - Add progress indicators using `tqdm` or logging
  - Log intermediate results for debugging
- **Design considerations for manual execution scripts**:

  - Use argparse for command-line arguments
  - Provide sensible defaults
  - Include `--dry-run` option for testing
  - Save outputs incrementally, not just at the end
  - Add verbose logging with timestamps

### 🔒 Data Privacy & Security

- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or functions** – only use known, verified Python packages.
- **Always confirm file paths and module names** exist before referencing them in code or tests.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed to or if part of a task
